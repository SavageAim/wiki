# API Schema

In order to support other developers who might want to build tooling to interact with the platform, there is now an OpenAPI Schema available at [https://savageaim.com/backend/schema](https://savageaim.com/backend/schema)

This page is created partially via automatic tooling and is partially handwritten. If there are any issues with the documentation, please let us know!
