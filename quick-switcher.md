# Quick-Switcher

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (49).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

A simple window that allows you to search for pages and move around the website faster. Accessible via `Ctrl`+`K` keybinds on desktop, or the following navigation buttons on all platforms;

By typing in the given search box (which is automatically focused when opening the window), the list of pages will be expanded and filtered.&#x20;

When there is no search term, the box will display all of your Characters and Teams, but searching allows you to filter through individual BIS Lists and the different Team pages you have access to as well.

Please note the switcher will only display 5 filtered items, like so;

On Desktop devices, the arrow keys can be used to move the selection (the blue text) up and down to your desired link, and pressing Enter will close the dialog and take you to the chosen page.

Alternatively, on all platforms, all of the displayed links can be clicked/tapped to do the same.
