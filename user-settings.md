# User Settings

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (15) (1) (1) (1).png>)

The User Settings page allows control over certain User specific details on the site. The different sections are outlined below.

## Colour Scheme

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1).png>)

This setting is used to control the colours used on the [#character-cards](teams/team-overview.md#character-cards "mention"). The dropdown at the top provides a list of the themes currently supported in the system. The choice is rendered in the table below, as a method of indicating what the chosen theme looks like.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only this table updates live, to update other tables you will need to save first.
{% endhint %}

If you want to submit your own colour scheme suggestion, something can be organised, but throw up an issue on the Github Repo if you can! One helpful tool I like to use is [https://vis4.net/palettes/#](https://vis4.net/palettes/), using 7 colours!

## Notifications

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (14) (1) (1).png>)

This panel controls the Notifications you will receive in the system. Individual types of Notifications can be turned off and on as required, so you have full control over what types of events you will be informed of.

{% hint style="info" %}
For full details on the Notifications in the system, check [notifications.md](notifications.md "mention")!
{% endhint %}
