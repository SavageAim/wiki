### About Savage Aim

Savage Aim is a Best in Slot (BiS) gear tracker for FFXIV Savage players and statics. It aims to provide a clear and helpful indication of how people are progressing towards their Best in Slot for a given raid tier for any of their jobs.

It was written in time for Pandaemonium Asphodelos, and it will be kept up to date with future gear releases and raid tiers for the foreseeable future.
