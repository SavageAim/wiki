# Per Fight Loot Manager

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png>)

In Patch 6.4, changes were introduced that made every fight's loot consistent. We designed a new alternative version of the Loot Manager page that takes advantage of these changes.

Instead of a dropdown for an item, you are presented with a dropdown for a whole fight. Selecting an item in this dropdown updates the page to look like this;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png>)

This works because every fight now consistently drops one of every possible item every time you kill it.

## Selecting Team Members

Each of the **Select a Team Member** boxes can be used to select a recipient just like in the original Loot Manager, and clicking on one presents a popup that looks like this;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png>)

There are Need and Greed tabs that show who needs the item for their main bis, and what alternative bis lists are in need of the item. To select a Need list, simply click or tap on the name.

To select a Greed list, you must first click or tap the name, which provides a dropdown like this;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (60).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As you can see, Character 2 has Greed Lists, which you can choose to give them and it will update the corresponding list when it is saved.&#x20;

Alternatively, you can just choose the Character by clicking the large "Give Item to Character" button to give the item to the Character without updating any lists.

## Viewing Chosen Members

When a Member is selected, the popup will close and the page will update to show some details about who was selected;

The blue / purple badges are the same as in [#numbered-badge](loot-tracker.md#numbered-badge "mention") in the original loot manager, with blue indicating that the item was a need, and purple for a greed.

The red "Clear" button below allows you to remove an allocation.

## Editing a Selection

If instead you chose the wrong member for an item and need to change it, clicking the box will display the same popup as before with no changes!

## Saving

Clicking the big green "Save Loot Assignments" button will send all the updates in one go, and will work as if you had sent each request individually in the original Loot Manager.
