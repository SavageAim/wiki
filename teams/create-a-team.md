# Create A Team

Now that you have hopefully set up at least one Character and one BIS List for them, you can start interacting with the Teams side of the app.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are joining somebody else's Team, please check the [join-a-team.md](join-a-team.md "mention") page instead.
{% endhint %}

Returning to the home page, it should now hopefully look something like this;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (25) (1) (2).png>)

{% hint style="warning" %}
If there are no Characters found, or your Character has a warning sign next to their name, please check the [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") page.
{% endhint %}

If all is well, we can proceed with making your first Team.

## Add New Team

Clicking the "Add New" button below the "Your Teams" box should take you to a page that looks like this;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (20) (1) (1) (1).png>)

For the purposes of this page, we will be ignoring the section at the bottom, and will instead click the "Create New Team" button at the top of the page, which should then take you to a page that looks like this;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (3).png>)

This page has four required inputs, as detailed below. Everything can be changed by you later, so don't worry if you aren't happy with your choices later!

### Team Name

This one is simple, just insert the name of the Team. It is up to you and can be up to 64 characters long.

### Tier

Select the Tier that the Team is currently involved with.

The Tier information is used to colour the tables in the [team-overview.md](team-overview.md "mention") page, and also the History in the [loot-tracker.md](loot-tracker.md "mention") page is saved on a Tier by Tier basis.

### Character

Select the Character you wish to have in the Team. Because you are the one creating the Team, this Character will be set to the Team's leader, though this can be changed later. Once you pick a Character, the BIS List input will be populated with the Lists belonging to your chosen Character.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can only have each Character be in a Team once, but there is nothing stopping you adding your alt Characters to the same Team to fill different roles as needed.&#x20;

Teams do not have a cap on the number of Characters they can have in them.

Similarly, there is no limit to how many Teams one of your Characters can be a part of either.
{% endhint %}

#### If you have no Characters

If you attempt to Create a new Team without having any Characters associated with your account, you'll see a message like this instead;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Filling out the two inputs with valid URLs will automatically create a Character and BIS List, then use those to create the Team!

### BIS List

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

Selecting a BIS List allows you to indicate the role that your Character is playing in the Team. Once you have selected a Character, a "Add New" button will also appear, which you can click to be given a popup version of the BIS List form. This will allow you to add a new BIS List without leaving the page.&#x20;

When you finish and close the popup, the BIS dropdown will refresh to include your newly created BIS List.&#x20;

### Create

Once you're happy with your choices, you can click the Create link at the bottom of the card. If all is well, you will receive a green notification and be redirected to your new [team-overview.md](team-overview.md "mention") page. If not, appropriate inputs will be marked in red and have text displayed indicating the issues that were found.
