# Join A Team

If instead you are joining someone else's team, you will need to receive either an **invite code** or **invite link** from the Team's Leader.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're a Team Leader and you're trying to find where to get these, please check [#invite-code](team-settings.md#invite-code "mention").
{% endhint %}

## Join Via Code

If you're joining via a code, you have a couple of extra steps to do over joining via a URL, which are outlined here!

### Add New Team

Starting from the Home page, click the "Add New" button under "Your Teams". You should be on this page;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1).png>)

Insert the code you were given in the box below, and click the "Join" button. If the code is correct, you should be taken to the same page as the **invite link** would have taken you, so we can continue the guide below.

## Joining The Team

Once you have arrived on a page like this, either by following the code step above or by following your given **invite link**, you will be able to join the Team.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1).png>)

The box above shows the current details of the Team you are joining. You can see the name and tier and, if you're on a large screen device, you can also see the icons of the Jobs that the Characters already in the Team are playing. The names of the Characters on each Job are available by hovering over them.

To join the Team, you need to fill out the two boxes below. The details of each are found in the [#character](create-a-team.md#character "mention") and [#bis-list](create-a-team.md#bis-list "mention") sections of the Create A Team page.

Once you're happy, click the "Join" button to be taken to the [team-details.md](team-details.md "mention") page. If something went wrong with the attempt, appropriate inputs will be marked in red and have error text displayed.
