# Manage Members

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)

The Manage Members page provides the ability for Members, Permissions, and Proxy Characters to be maintained in a single place.

The page provides the Team Lead with the options of granting extra Permissions to certain Characters, kicking Characters from the Team, and managing any Proxy Characters the Team has.

Similarly, any other Character in the Team can also view this page to see the permissions status for other Members.

## Team Permissions

### Loot Manager

Members with this permission will have full access to the controls of the Loot Manager page, which allows them to hand out gear to Members, and track Loot drops just like the Team Leader.

### Proxy Manager

Members with this permission will have the ability to add new Proxy to the Team, as well the ability to edit or even kick existing Proxy Characters.

See [proxy-characters.md](proxy-characters.md "mention") for more details!

## Team Members

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (31).png" alt="" data-size="original">

The left hand side card (on desktop) contains the details for all of the User-owned Team Members. Each are shown with the purple / blue tags that indicate the Member's permissions.

Team Leaders are also provided with two buttons for each Member, allowing them to change their permissions, or kick the Member from the Team. The Kick button in the Team Overview page has been moved to here instead to simplify the Team Overview page as much as possible.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the case where one User has multiple Characters in a Team, please be aware that they will have any permission any of their Characters have.
{% endhint %}

## Proxy Characters

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

The right hand side card (on desktop) has the controls for any Proxy Characters that the Team has.

At the top is a button allowing any User with permission to add a new Proxy Character.

Similarly, the buttons alongside the Proxies will be displayed to anyone who has the permission, allowing Members other than the Leader to control Proxy Character Membership.

For more information about Proxy Characters, please see the [proxy-characters.md](proxy-characters.md "mention") page.
