# Proxy Characters

For the most part, these Characters are equivalent to the Characters made / managed by regular Users of the site. However, these are instead managed by the Team Leader, which allows Leaders to have all of their Members represented without requiring everyone to sign up to Savage Aim.

## Adding Proxy Characters

A Team Leader when viewing the Team Details page will see the following image, with a green "Add Proxy Character" button.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

Clicking on this button will take them to a page that looks like this;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png>)

To begin to add a Proxy Character, first you must obtain the Lodestone URL for the Character, similar to when adding a new Character to your own account. When the URL has been added and imported, a BIS List form will display underneath and the form will change appearance, like so;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png>)

The BIS List form is almost the exact same as the normal one available to Characters, with some minor changes. Proxy BIS Lists cannot be given names, and all buttons related to Syncing have been removed.

To change the Character, you can click the red "Reset" button which will change the box back into the form.

To save the Proxy Character, click the green "Create" button under the Character when you've filled in all this BIS Details.

## Updating Proxy Characters

When added to the Team, Proxy Characters will have a red AFK chair next to their names in desktop versions of the Team Details page. For the Team Leader, there will also be an "Edit Proxy" option in their "Actions" dropdown, which will take them to the same page as shown above, only the ability to reset the Character is no longer present.

To remove a Proxy Character from the Team, simply kick them.&#x20;

## Verifying and Claiming Proxy Characters

If, at a later point in time, the owner of a Proxy Character signs up to the website, they will still be able to claim and verify the Character as their own.&#x20;

Whenever a Proxy Character is claimed, the Team Leader will receive a Notification informing them that it has occurred.

### Importing and Verifying like normal

If a User goes through the process outlined in [importing-characters.md](../characters/importing-characters.md "mention") to add and verify a Character that they own, then all proxies of that Character will be merged into the new verified version of the Character.

The User will immediately have access to any Teams the Character was proxied in, and will have all BIS Lists that any Teams were maintaining for them.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Each BIS List will be given the name of the Team that created it when merged into the account, so even if there are multiple lists with the same Job, it will be obvious which one is which.
{% endhint %}

### Claiming Characters via Team Join

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)

A slight alternative to streamline the process a little is the option to attempt a claim via the [join-a-team.md](join-a-team.md "mention") pages.

Clicking on one of the Proxy Character boxes on the right will take you to a copy of the Character for you to verify. When a Character is verified, it will merge in all Proxy versions, which means you will join the specified Team as well!

This means new Users to the site can gain control of their Character in a slightly easier way than having to handle it from outside the Team pages.
