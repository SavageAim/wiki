# Proxy Characters

Proxy Characters are special Characters that can be imported to specific Teams to maintain BIS data for XIV Characters whose players are not signed up to the website.

For all intents and purposes, they function almost identically to User-owned Characters, but are instead managed by any Member of a Team who has been given permission.

{% hint style="info" %}
To access the functionality for adding / editing / removing Proxy Characters, please see the [manage-members.md](manage-members.md "mention") page.
{% endhint %}

## Adding Proxy Characters

Clicking the "Add Proxy Character" button on the Manage Members page will take you to a page that looks like this;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (19) (1).png>)

The BIS List form is almost the exact same as the normal one available to Characters, with some minor changes. Proxy BIS Lists cannot be given names, and all buttons related to Syncing have been removed.

To select a Character, you must provide the Lodestone link in the input at the top of the page and then press "Import". This will change the top card into something that looks like this;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (32).png>)

Once you fill in the BIS details below, you can click on the green "Create Proxy" to submit. If you accidentally copied the wrong Lodestone URL, you can instead click the red "Change Character" button to see the input once more.

When added to the Team, Proxy Characters are displayed with the red chair AFK icon in the overview page, like so;

Apart from that, they function identically to User-owned Characters, appearing in the Loot Manager when necessary, etc.

## Updating Proxy Characters

To update a Proxy Character, simply click the "Edit Proxy BIS" button on the Manage Members page. This will take you to a very similar looking form, without the button to "Change Character";

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png>)

Any additional updates to the BIS can be performed here.&#x20;

If instead you wish to use a different Character as a Proxy, you should Kick the previously created one from the Manage Members page, and then Create a new one from scratch.

## Verifying and Claiming Proxy Characters

If, at a later point in time, the owner of a Proxy Character signs up to the website, they will still be able to claim and verify the Character as their own.&#x20;

Whenever a Proxy Character is claimed, the Team Leader will receive a Notification informing them that it has occurred.

### Importing and Verifying like normal

If a User goes through the process outlined in [importing-characters.md](../characters/importing-characters.md "mention") to add and verify a Character that they own, then all proxies of that Character will be merged into the new verified version of the Character.

The User will immediately have access to any Teams the Character was proxied in, and will have all BIS Lists that any Teams were maintaining for them.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Each BIS List will be given the name of the Team that created it when merged into the account, so even if there are multiple lists with the same Job, it will be obvious which one is which.
{% endhint %}

### Claiming Characters via Team Join

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1).png>)

A slight alternative to streamline the process a little is the option to attempt a claim via the [join-a-team.md](join-a-team.md "mention") pages.

Clicking on one of the Proxy Character boxes on the right will take you to a copy of the Character for you to verify. When a Character is verified, it will merge in all Proxy versions, which means you will join the specified Team as well!

This means new Users to the site can gain control of their Character in a slightly easier way than having to handle it from outside the Team pages.
