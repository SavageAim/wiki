# Team Overview

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (3) (1) (1).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
In the above image, I have joined the Team on an alt, just to show some different features.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The Team Overview page is the main view of the Team. It shows all of the Characters in the Team, and all of their BIS List details.&#x20;

At the top of the page are blue buttons, which link to [loot-tracker.md](loot-tracker.md "mention"), [manage-members.md](manage-members.md "mention"), and [team-settings.md](team-settings.md "mention").&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that the settings link will only appear if you are the current Team Leader.
{% endhint %}

## Character Cards

Each Character has a card with all of their details. In this section, all of the card's components will be broken down and explained.

The Characters are sorted by their Jobs, in the same order as FFXIV uses to list Jobs, so Tanks come first, then Healers, then Melee, Ranged Physical and finally Caster DPS. Characters with the same Job will be ordered by their names.

### Heading

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (2).png>)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (16) (1) (1).png>)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (3).png>)

The heading of the cards gives us a lot of information. On mobile a lot of the extraneous info is stripped out to maintain clarity however.

#### Team Leader / Member / Proxy Icons

On the far left side of the header, you can see icons taken from XIV. The P with an L beneath it indicates the Team Leader, and all other Team Members will just have the P icon with no L.

Proxy Characters are instead represented by the AFK red chair icon.

#### Character Name & World / Alias

Most of the time when Characters are displayed, they have the name and world displayed together. This is because Characters from different worlds can have the same names.

If Characters have an alias instead, it will instead display the alias of the Character. This was chosen since Team Members may have some air of familiarity and will know people by their alias.

#### Item Level Tag

Similar to [#character-page-display](../characters/bis-lists.md#character-page-display "mention"), the card heading has a tag that shows the current item level of the Character, as well as their role using the colour of the tag.

#### Job Icon

At the right hand side is just the icon of the Job the Character is playing.

### Table

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (1) (1).png>)

The coloured table is the most important part of the card. In a glance it can tell you how someone is progressing towards getting their BIS.

{% hint style="info" %}
For Paladins, the top row will have 4 boxes, two for mainhand and two for offhand, similar to the rest of the table.&#x20;

All other jobs only have a Weapon so the table renders the top row with no offhand.
{% endhint %}

#### Text

The text in the coloured boxes indicates the **Best in Slot** item for that Character in that slot.

#### Colour

The colour of the boxes indicates the **item level of the gear currently equipped** in that slot.

#### Hover / Tap&#x20;

Hovering over (on PC) or tapping on (mobile / tablets) any of the coloured boxes displays the **name of the gear currently equipped** in that slot.

### Footer Actions

Along the bottom of the card, there will be some buttons to interact with the Character. On Mobile, there will be just an "Actions" button which opens up a dropdown showing the exact same actions.

#### &#x20;View Externally

This option appears on all cards where the chosen BIS List has filled out the URL input. The text will be the domain that the URL points to.

#### Edit BIS

This option appears only on the card of your own Characters. This will take you directly to the edit page of the BIS List you have assigned to the Team for you to edit it quickly.

#### Update Membership

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (23) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

This option appears only on the card of your own Characters. It will take you to a page that allows you to change the Character and/or BIS List associated with the Team.

#### Leave Team

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (17) (2).png>)

This button will appear on the bottom of Characters that you own, and will prompt you with a popup to ensure you're sure you want to leave the Team.

### Colour Scheme

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>FFLogs Colour Scheme</p></figcaption></figure>

The tables use colours to indicate the difference between the BIS Item for a slot (indicated by the text in the box) and the Current Item.&#x20;

When you choose a [#colour-scheme](../user-settings.md#colour-scheme "mention"), the table displayed on the page indicates how the different Item Levels are displayed in colour.

The non-BIS colours are generated off of the Max Item Level for the Tier. For example, an Accessory with Item Level 650 in a Tier with Max Item Level of 665 would be rendered with the "Max IL - 15" colour, if it was not the correct item for the slot.
