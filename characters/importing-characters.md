# Importing Characters

## Initial View

When you log in to Savage Aim for the first time, the home screen should look something like this;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (1) (3).png>)

For the purposes of this document, we will be focusing on the Character section on the right. To begin importing your first Character, click the green "Add New" button below the "Your Characters" section.

## Add A Character

Clicking on the button will take you to this page;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1) (1) (1).png>)

Savage Aim uses the Lodestone for getting information about Characters, so we need to provide a URL for it to pull data from. Begin by finding the page for your Character using the Lodestone Character Search: [https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/](https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that the URL should end like `/lodestone/character/22909725/` and not `/lodestone/my/`
{% endhint %}

If all goes well, after you click import you should be taken to your Character page! If any error occurs with the import, a red box and red text will appear with the details. If this isn't something you can do anything about, please report it to the team!

When your Character is imported from Lodestone, you will be redirected to a page that looks like this;

The site is now fully useable with this Character, despite the warning messages! To ensure you don't lose data, it is encouraged you continue with verifying your Character, but you have 7 days from creation to do so!

For a full breakdown of what this page can display, check the [character-details.md](character-details.md "mention") page!

## Verifying Your Character

{% hint style="info" %}
When you first import a Character, it will be unverified. SavageAim will want to ensure that people are signing up with their own Characters.

However, in the interest of streamlining the new User process; Characters that aren't verified can still use the system as normal for 7 days.

If a Character has not been verified in 7 days after it's made, it will be deleted.
{% endhint %}

The amber box contains a message indicating that your character is unverified. Below the gray line is some text in blue, and a button. The text in blue is your verification code, which you will need to add to your Lodestone profile to ensure us that the Character is owned by the person that says they own it!

Copy the full code in the black box, and then visit [https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/my/setting/profile/](https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/my/setting/profile/) (there is a link to this page in the verification message also, where it says \<u>this page\</u>). In the box, enter the verification code like so;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (19) (1) (1) (1).png>)

Then click Confirm, and on the next page, click Confirm again. Once your Character's Lodestone profile has been updated, you can return to the Savage Aim page and click the Request Verification button. If all is well you should see a green popup stating that the request was successful.&#x20;

After the verification has succeeded, the amber message box, along with the warning sign, will have disappeared. This indicates your Character is now safe from automated deletion!
