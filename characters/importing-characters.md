# Importing Characters

## Initial View

When you log in to Savage Aim for the first time, the home screen should look something like this;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

For the purposes of this document, we will be focusing on the Character section on the right. To begin importing your first Character, click the green "Add New" button below the "Your Characters" section.

## Add A Character

Clicking on the button will take you to this page;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1) (1).png>)

Savage Aim uses the Lodestone for getting information about Characters, so we need to provide a URL for it to pull data from. Begin by finding the page for your Character using the Lodestone Character Search: [https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/](https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that the URL should end like `/lodestone/character/22909725/` and not `/lodestone/my/`
{% endhint %}

If all goes well, after you click import you should be taken to your Character page! If any error occurs with the import, a red box and red text will appear with the details. If this isn't something you can do anything about, please report it to the team!

## Verifying Your Character

{% hint style="info" %}
When you first import a Character, it will be unverified. The site needs to ensure that the people who say they own a Character really do own a Character, so you will be requested to verify the Character before you can start properly interacting with the site.
{% endhint %}

When you get redirected to your new Character page, it should initially look something like this;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png>)

The amber box contains a message indicating that your character is unverified. Below the gray line is some text in blue, and a button. The text in blue is your verification code, which you will need to add to your Lodestone profile to ensure us that the Character is owned by the person that says they own it!

Copy the full code in blue, and then visit [https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/my/setting/profile/](https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/my/setting/profile/) (there is a link to this page in the verification message also, where it says \<u>this page\</u>). In the box, enter the verification code like so;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (19) (1) (1).png>)

Then click Confirm, and on the next page, click Confirm again. Once your Character's Lodestone profile has been updated, you can return to the Savage Aim page and click the Request Verification button. If all is well you should see a green popup stating that the request was successful.&#x20;

After a few seconds, refresh the page and if the verification was successful you should see the amber message has been replaced with a page that looks like this;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png>)
