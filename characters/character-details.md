# Character Details

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (19) (1).png>)![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

## Character Bio

At the top left of the page is the Character Bio. It shows some information about the Character whose page you are currently on; their avatar from the Lodestone, name and world information.

This information is not editable due to how Characters are imported.

At the bottom is a button to request the deletion of the Character.

### Deletion

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1).png>)

Due to all the information being linked to the Character entry, deletion of Characters provides a detailed prompt like shown.

The popup provides a list of items that will happen when a Character is deleted, and a text box in which you must type the name of the Character to confirm you are happy with their deletion.

#### Results of Deletion

* Character will leave Teams it is not the Leader of.
* Character will disband Teams it leads with only one Character in them.
* Character will pass Team Leadership to another Character in Teams they lead with multiple Characters.
* All BIS Lists belonging to the Character will be deleted.

## Navigation

Below the Character Bio card is a small card that allows for switching between sections of the Character page.

If any extra sections can be added to the Character page, they will be added to the Navigation just like BIS Lists and Teams.

Only displaying one section at a time allows the page to display a lot more detail than it could when it was displaying everything at once!

## BIS Lists

The BIS Lists section shows all of the Character's BIS Lists, in the same format as they are displayed on the [team-details.md](../teams/team-details.md "mention") page.

The major difference between the displays on the Team and Character pages is as follows;

On the Team page, colours are generated using the max item level of the Tier the Team is currently in.&#x20;

On the Character page, because there is no link between BIS Lists and a Tier, the colours are generated using the item level of the Gear in the BIS Mainhand slot. Typically, this will be the raid weapon so it will correspond with a Tier's maximum item level anyway, but it is worth keeping in mind in case your BIS weapon is not the one that drops from the raid.

{% hint style="info" %}
For safety and less confusion, the cards on the Character page contain a message stating the item level they use to generate the colours beneath the table.
{% endhint %}

To edit an existing BIS List, click the "Edit" link at the bottom of the corresponding card. To create a new BIS List, click the purple "Add New" button above the lists.

### Deletion

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

Deleting a BIS List will permanently remove it from the Character. To Delete a BIS List simply click the "Delete" button below the card. Clicking this button will cause a popup like the above images to appear.

If the chosen BIS List is in use in a Team, it won't be eligible for deletion until you either change the BIS List you're using, or leave the Team entirely.

If there are Teams the BIS List is in use in, the "Change" link will take you directly to the Team Member management page for you to change Character and/or BIS List used in the Team.

If the BIS List is not in use, it is safe to delete, like the Paladin example to the right.

## Teams

The Teams section shows all of the Teams the Character is a part of, in a similar format to how they are displayed on the Home page. There are four sections of note to how each Team is displayed.

The dark box around each Team is a link, and clicking anywhere on the dark box will take you to that Team's page.

The blue P icon to the left indicates that the Character is a regular Member of the Team. If they were instead the Team Leader, the icon displayed would be ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>) instead.

To the right of the icon, is the name of the Team. Below that is the name of the Tier the Team is currently working on.

At the bottom of the box, there is a set of Job icons. This is a list of icons of all the jobs of the Characters on the Team.

On mobile, only the name of the Team and its Tier are displayed.

## Settings

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png>)

Characters now have aliases, which is a name you can specify yourself to refer to the Character separately. The settings tab allows you to change your aliases.

If set, aliases are displayed in the Character Bio card alongside the Character Name and Home World, and will be used in Team pages instead of the Character / World pattern currently in use.
