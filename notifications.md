# Notifications

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (21) (1).png>)



The Notifications panel, as outlined above, allows you to receive updates about things that happen in the system outside of your control. This panel will only ever load the latest 20 Notifications you have received.

Clicking or tapping on any of the Notifications will navigate you to the page related to the Notification, and will also mark the notification as read. Read Notifications will lose the blue border, and the bell icon next to them will no longer be ringing, as seen in this image. ![](<.gitbook/assets/image (24) (1).png>)

Types of Notifications can be individually disabled in the [#notifications](user-settings.md#notifications "mention") page. Please note that this will only stop future Notifications of that type, all existing ones will remain.

Clicking the "Mark All As Read" button will do exactly that, marking all your current Notifications as read, without needing to open them all individually.

Clicking the "View All Notifications" page will take you to a separate page that contains every Notification you have received. This is just to allow the User to see all their Notifications, without holding up the running of the main site with trying to load them when they just need to use the main pages.

## Unread Badge

Desktop View -![](<.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1).png>)\
Mobile View -![](<.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

In the Navigation Bar, as shown above, there is an unread badge in both Desktop and Mobile views that indicates how many unread notifications you have. This is just to help bring it to your attention whenever new Notifications arrive.

## Notifications Page

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (17) (1).png>)

For consistency's sake, this is just a larger version of the Notifications popup. This page can list more than the 20 limit contained in the popup version.

Everything works here like it does in the popup as detailed above!
